A  program  that  reads  a text  file  and  counts  the  occurrences  of  each  letter  in  the  English alphabet (case-insensitive).
The program should use loops and pointer arguments to process the text file, and an array to store the counts.
Implement a function to handle letter case conversion and print the results in a tabular format.
